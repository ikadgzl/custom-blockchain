This is my blockchain project, built with javascript and nodejs(express framework), used both vanilla JS (not classes but prototype) and ES6.

# How to run the project?

1.first npm install to install the dependencies, such as express.
2.inside the separate terminals, follow the command in package.json -> scripts to create separate network nodes.
3.test the end points.
